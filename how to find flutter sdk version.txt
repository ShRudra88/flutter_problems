There are three primary ways to check your Flutter version:

1. Using the Command Line (Simplest and most direct approach)

2. Employing flutter doctor (Provides a comprehensive health report)

3. Inspecting the pubspec.lock File (For specific project version)
3. Checking Project Version (Using pubspec.lock File)
If you’re working with a cloned Flutter project, you can determine the version it was created with. This can help understand the project’s requirements and potential compatibility issues. Here’s how to find it.
Locate the pubspec.lock File: This file resides in the project’s root directory.
Open the File: Use a text editor to open the pubspec.lock file.
Find the Flutter Version: Search for lines containing “flutter”. You’ll find a line specifying the exact Flutter version used during development.
